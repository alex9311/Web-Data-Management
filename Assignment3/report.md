####Introduction
For this assignment, we built two solutions to the problem of finding triangles inside graphs. First, we use regular Hadoop map-reduce to solve the problem. Next, we used Apache Giraph (which also uses Hadoop) to count triangles. Both the solutions are written in Java and are jarred up in a single jar file. This file is used to call eiher solution. 

In addition to these two solutions, we also built a script that automates the running of both solutions on a given graph. The script also runs a brute-force php solution we implemented to check the output.
