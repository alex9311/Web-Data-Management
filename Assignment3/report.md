####Introduction
For this assignment, we built two solutions to the problem of finding triangles inside graphs, one with Hadoop and one with Apache Giraph. For the first sollution we used Apache Giraph (which uses Hadoop) to count triangles. Next, we used regular Hadoop map-reduce to solve the problem. Both the solutions are written in Java and are jarred up in a single jar file. This file is used to call eiher solution. 

In addition to these two solutions, we also built a script that automates the running of both solutions on a given graph. The script also runs a brute-force php solution we implemented to check the output.
